# 🕸️ WikiScraper: Scraping Wikipedia Using Selenium in Python

Welcome to **WikiScraper**! In this project, we’ll scrape data from Wikipedia using the **Selenium** library in Python. By mastering Selenium’s web scraping commands, we’ll fetch HTML elements, automate events on a web page, and clean the scraped text using **regex**. Let’s dive into the world of web scraping and automation! 🌐🤖

## 🌐 Project Overview

Web scraping involves extracting information from websites, and **Selenium** allows us to automate this process efficiently. In this project, we’ll use Selenium to scrape Wikipedia, the largest and most popular online encyclopedia. We’ll automate events on Wikipedia pages, fetch various HTML elements, and clean the retrieved data using **regex** for further analysis. By the end of the project, we’ll store the scraped data in **Python dictionaries** for easy access and manipulation.
